Nuclei is a fast tool for configurable targeted scanning based on templates offering massive extensibility and ease of use.

Nuclei is used to send requests across targets based on a template leading to zero false positives and providing effective scanning for known paths. Main use cases for nuclei are during initial reconnaissance phase to quickly check for low hanging fruits or CVEs across targets that are known and easily detectable. It uses [retryablehttp-go library](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/retryablehttp-go) designed to handle various errors and retries in case of blocking by WAFs, this is also one of our core modules from custom-queries.

We have also [open-sourced a template repository](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei-templates) to maintain various type of templates, we hope that you will contribute there too. Templates are provided in hopes that these will be useful and will allow everyone to build their own templates for the scanner. Checkout the templating guide at [**nuclei.projectdiscovery.io**](https://nuclei.projectdiscovery.io/templating-guide/) for a primer on nuclei templates.

## Installation Instructions

### From Binary

The installation is easy. You can download the pre-built binaries for your platform from the [Releases](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei/releases/) page. Extract them using tar, move it to your `$PATH`and you're ready to go.

```sh
Download latest binary from https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei/releases

â–¶ tar -xzvf nuclei-linux-amd64.tar.gz
â–¶ mv nuclei /usr/local/bin/
â–¶ nuclei -version
```

### From Source

nuclei requires **go1.14+** to install successfully. Run the following command to get the repo -

```sh
â–¶ GO111MODULE=on go get -u -v github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei/v2/cmd/nuclei
```

### From Github

```sh
â–¶ git clone https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei.git; cd nuclei/v2/cmd/nuclei/; go build; mv nuclei /usr/local/bin/; nuclei -version
```

## Nuclei templates

You can download or update the nuclei templates using `update-templates` flag.

```sh
â–¶ nuclei -update-templates
```

or download it from [nuclei templates](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei-templates) Github project.

```sh
â–¶ git clone https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei-templates.git
```

**Please refer to nuclei [templating guide](https://nuclei.projectdiscovery.io/templating-guide/) to writing your own custom templates.**

## Running nuclei

### Running with single template.

This will run `git-core.yaml` template against all the hosts in `urls.txt` and returns the matched results.

```sh
â–¶ nuclei -l urls.txt -t files/git-core.yaml -o results.txt
```

You can also pass the list of urls at standard input (STDIN). This allows for easy integration in automation pipelines.

```sh
â–¶ cat urls.txt | nuclei -t files/git-core.yaml -o results.txt
```

ðŸ’¡ Nuclei accepts list of URLs as input, for example here is how `urls.txt` looks like:- 

```
https://test.some-site.com
http://vuls-testing.com
https://test.com
```
### Running with multiple templates.

This will run the tool against all the urls in `urls.txt` with all the templates in the `cves` and `files` directory and returns the matched results.

```sh
â–¶ nuclei -l urls.txt -t cves/ -t files/ -o results.txt
```

### Running with subfinder.

```sh
â–¶ subfinder -d hackerone.com -silent | httpx -silent | nuclei -t cves/ -o results.txt
```

### Running in Docker container

You can use the [nuclei dockerhub image](https://hub.docker.com/r/projectdiscovery/nuclei). Simply run -

```sh
â–¶ docker pull projectdiscovery/nuclei
```

After downloading or building the container, run the following:

```sh
â–¶ docker run -it projectdiscovery/nuclei
```

For example, this will run the tool against all the hosts in `urls.txt` and output the results to your host file system:

```sh
â–¶ cat urls.txt | docker run -v /path/to/nuclei-templates:/app/nuclei-templates -v /path/to/nuclei/config:/app/.nuclei-config.json -i projectdiscovery/nuclei -t /app/nuclei-templates/files/git-config.yaml > results.txt
```

Remember to change `/path-to-nuclei-templates` to the real path on your host file system.

### Template Exclusion

[Nuclei-templates](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei-templates) includes multiple checks including many that are useful for attack surface mapping and not necessarily a security issue, in cases where you only looking to scan few specific templates or directory, here are few options / flags to filter or exclude them from running. 

#### Running templates based on severity

You can run the templates based on the specific severity of the template, single and multiple severity can be used for scan. 

```sh
nuclei -l urls.txt -t cves/ -severity critical, medium
```

The above example will run all the templates under `cves` directory with `critical` and `medium` severity. 

```sh
nuclei -l urls.txt -t panels/ -t technologies -severity info
```

The above example will run all the templates under `panels` and `technologies` directory with **severity** marked as `info`

#### Running templates with exclusion

We do not suggest running all the nuclei-templates directory at once, in case of doing so, one can make use of `exclude` flag to exclude specific directory or templates to ignore from scanning. 

```sh
nuclei -l urls.txt -t nuclei-templates -exclude panels/ -exclude technologies -exclude files/wp-xmlrpc.yaml
```

Note:- both directory and specific templates case be excluded from scan as shared in the above example.

#### Using `.nuclei-ignore` file for template exclusion

Since release of nuclei [v2.1.1](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei/releases/tag/v2.1.1), we have added support of `.nuclei-ignore` file that works along with `update-templates` flag of nuclei, in **.nuclei-ignore** file, you can define all the template directory or template path that you wanted to exclude from all the nuclei scans, to start using this feature, make sure you installed nuclei templates using `nuclei -update-templates` flag, now you can add/update/remove templates in the file that you wanted to exclude from running. 

```
nano ~/nuclei-templates/.nuclei-ignore
```

Default **nuclei-ignore** list can be accessed from [here](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei-templates/blob/master/.nuclei-ignore), in case you don't want to exclude anything, simply remove the `.nuclei-ignore` file.

- Progress bar is experimental feature, might not work in few cases. 
- Progress bar doesn't work with workflows, numbers are not accurate due to conditional execution.
